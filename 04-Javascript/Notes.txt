                                         JAVASCRIPT

         1. Javascript is a high-level,Object-Oriented,Multi-paradigm Programming language. 
         Detail explain  given below:-


         .> high-level means -  We don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
         .> programming language means - Instruct computer to do things.  
         .> object-oriented means - Based on objects, For storing most kinds of data .
         .> multi-paradigm means - We can use differnt styles of programming.

        2. There is nothing you can't do with Javascript.Example:-
        Dynamic effect and web applications in the browser, Web applications on web servers, Native mobile applications.
        ReactNative.js,ionic.js,react.js, angularity.js,view.js,node.js.
                                          
                                           Variables
        // To make variable we use (let)
        .> The first word never be a number of a variable.for Example: 3years = 3;
        .> We use number between or end of a variable. For Example:years3 or age100person;
        .> Underscore used before in a variable.

                                           Values
        .> These are of two types: 
         1. Objects:- let person = {
        name: "Rahul";
        }       

        2. primitive: let firstname = "Rahul";
        let age = 20;

        It contain seven datatypes:
        1. number: Floating point number  => used for decimal and integers
        2. string: Sequence of Characters => used for text
        3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false => used for taking decisions
        4. undefined: value taken by a variable that is not yet defined(empty value)
        5. null: also means empty value
        6. symbol: value that is unique and cannot be changed
        7. BigInt: larger integers than the number can hold.                               

        **  control + Shift + j key used to open console tab directly
        **  Javascript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the datatype and the value stored in a variable . Instead, datatype are determined automatically.
             values has type, not variable.

                   let vs const vs variable
                  
                  ``Backtick Symbol:->
                  -> `` symbol used to create string evenly used to alter the sequence lines.

8. Hoisting:-> function call before declaration.it is found in Function Declaration.
